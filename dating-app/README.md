# Project Description
Dating is a web application aimed at facilitating connections and fostering relationships among individuals in Kenya.
The app will provide a platform for users to create profiles, search for potential matches, and interact with other users through messaging and various communication features. 
The goal of the app is to provide a safe and user-friendly environment for people to find compatible partners and explore meaningful connections.

# Project Solution Statement
The problem this project aims to solve is the lack of a dedicated platform for online dating in Kenya. While there are existing dating apps available in Kenya, Love Leaves Here acknowledges that existing dating platforms may not specifically cater to the Kenyan market or offer features tailored to local culture and preferences. 
To address these limitations, Love Leaves Here aims to provide a localized platform where Kenyan individuals can connect with like-minded individuals, creating a sense of community and increasing the likelihood of finding compatible partners.

# Project Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Love Lives Here will consist of several key features. 

- User registration and profile creation: Users will be able to register and create profiles by providing essential information such as their name, age, location, and interests. They can also enhance their profiles by adding profile pictures and writing a short bio.

- Search and matching functionality: The platform will include a search and matching functionality, allowing users to search for potential matches based on specific criteria such as age range, location, and shared interests. A matching algorithm will be incorporated to suggest compatible profiles to users.

- Messaging and communication: Kenya Dating will facilitate messaging and communication between users and their matches. Basic messaging features, including text-based communication, will be available to facilitate interactions and foster connections.

- User profile management: Users will have the ability to edit and update their profiles as needed. This includes adding or changing profile pictures, updating their bio, and adjusting their preferences to ensure a personalized experience.

By incorporating these features into its MVP, Kenya Dating aims to create a comprehensive platform that addresses the unique needs and preferences of the Kenyan market, offering a localized and user-friendly experience for individuals seeking meaningful relationships.
