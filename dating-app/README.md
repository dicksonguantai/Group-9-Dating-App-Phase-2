# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Dating is a web application aimed at facilitating connections and fostering relationships among individuals in Kenya.
The app will provide a platform for users to create profiles, search for potential matches, and interact with other users through messaging and various communication features. 
The goal of the app is to provide a safe and user friendly environment for people to find compatible partners and explore meaningful connections.

# PROJECT SOLUTION STATEMENT
The problem this project aims to solve is the lack of a dedicated platform  for online dating in Kenya While there are existing dating apps available in Kenya Dating acknowledges that existing dating platforms may not specifically cater for the Kenyan market or offer features tailored to local culture and preferences. 
To address these limitations, Love Leaves Here aims to provide a localized platform where Kenyan individuals can connect with like-minded individuals, creating a sense of community and increasing the likelihood of finding compatible partners.

# PROJECT MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT MVP
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Love Lives Here will consist of several key features. 
Firstly, users will have the ability to register and create profiles, providing essential information such as their name, age, location, and interests. 
Additionally, they can enhance their profiles by adding profile pictures and writing a short bio.
The platform will also include a search and matching functionality, allowing users to search for potential matches based on specific criteria such as age range, location, and shared interests. To facilitate the matching process, the app will incorporate a matching algorithm that suggests compatible profiles to users.
Furthermore, Kenya Dating will facilitate messaging and communication between users and their matches. Basic messaging features, including text-based communication, will be available to facilitate interactions and foster connections.
User profile management will be an integral part of the platform, enabling users to edit and update their profiles as needed. This includes the ability to add or change profile pictures, update their bio, and adjust their preferences to ensure a personalized experience.
By incorporating these features into its MVP, Kenya Dating aims to create a comprehensive platform that addresses the unique needs and preferences of the Kenyan market, offering a localized and user-friendly experience for individuals seeking meaningful relationships.
